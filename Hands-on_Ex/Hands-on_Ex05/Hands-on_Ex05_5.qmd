# **Treemap Visualisation with R**

## 1 Overview

A [Treemap](https://www.data-to-viz.com/graph/treemap.html) displays [hierarchical]{.underline} data as a set of nested rectangles. Each group is represented by a rectangle, which area is proportional to its value. Using color schemes and or interactivity, it is possible to represent several dimensions: groups, subgroups etc.

We will learn using selected functions provided in **dplyr** package, how to plot static treemap by using **treemap** package and design interactive treemap by using **d3treeR** package.

## 2 Install and Launch R Packages

Check if **treemap** and **tidyverse** pacakges have been installed in R.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(treemap, treemapify, tidyverse) 
```

## 3 Data Preparation

::: panel-tabset
## Import dataset

*read_csv()* of **readr** is used to import realis2018.csv into R and parsed it into tibble R data.frame format. The output tibble data.frame is called *realis2018*.

```{r}
realis2018 <- read_csv("data/realis2018.csv")
```

## Data wrangling

The data.frame *realis2018* is in trasaction record form, which is highly disaggregated and not appropriate to be used to plot a treemap. We will do the following the prepare a data frame for treemap visualisation.

-   group transaction records by *Project Name*, *Planning Region*, *Planning Area*, *Property Type* and *Type of Sale*, and

-   compute *Total Unit Sold*, *Total Area*, *Median Unit Price* and *Median Transacted Price* by applying appropriate summary statistics on *No. of Units*, *Area (sqm)*, *Unit Price (\$ psm)* and *Transacted Price (\$)* respectively.

*group_by()* and *summarize()* will be used to perform these steps.

**Grouped summaries without the Pipe**

```{r}
realis2018_grouped <- group_by(realis2018, `Project Name`,
                               `Planning Region`, `Planning Area`, 
                               `Property Type`, `Type of Sale`)
realis2018_summarised <- summarise(realis2018_grouped, 
                          `Total Unit Sold` = sum(`No. of Units`, na.rm = TRUE),
                          `Total Area` = sum(`Area (sqm)`, na.rm = TRUE),
                          `Median Unit Price ($ psm)` = median(`Unit Price ($ psm)`, na.rm = TRUE), 
                          `Median Transacted Price` = median(`Transacted Price ($)`, na.rm = TRUE))
```

-   Aggregation functions such as sum() and `median()` obey the usual rule of missing values: if there’s any missing value in the input, the output will be a missing value. The argument na.rm = TRUE removes the missing values prior to computation.
-   The code chunk above is not very efficient because we have to give each intermediate data.frame a name, even though we don’t have to care about it.

**Grouped summaries with the pipe** %\>%

The code chunk below shows a more efficient way to tackle the same processes by using the pipe, %\>%.

```{r}
realis2018_summarised <- realis2018 %>% 
  group_by(`Project Name`,`Planning Region`, 
           `Planning Area`, `Property Type`, 
           `Type of Sale`) %>%
  summarise(`Total Unit Sold` = sum(`No. of Units`, na.rm = TRUE), 
            `Total Area` = sum(`Area (sqm)`, na.rm = TRUE),
            `Median Unit Price ($ psm)` = median(`Unit Price ($ psm)`, na.rm = TRUE),
            `Median Transacted Price` = median(`Transacted Price ($)`, na.rm = TRUE))

```

Grouping affects the verbs as follows
:::

::: goals-container
-   grouped *select()* is the same as ungrouped *select()*, except that grouping variables are always retained.
-   grouped *arrange()* is the same as ungrouped; unless you set *.by_group = TRUE*, in which case it orders first by the grouping variables.
-   *mutate()* and *filter()* are most useful in conjunction with window functions (like *rank()*, or *min(x) == x*). They are described in detail in vignette(“window-functions”).
-   *sample_n()* and *sample_frac()* sample the specified number/fraction of rows in each group.
-   *summarise()* computes the summary for each group.

## 4 Design Treemap with treemap Package

*treemap()* offers at least 43 arguments. In this section, we will only explore the major arguments for designing elegent and yet truthful treemaps.

### 4.1 Design a static treemap

*treemap()* of **Treemap** package is used to plot a treemap showing the distribution of median unit prices and total unit sold of resale condominium by geographic hierarchy in 2017.

First, we will select records belongs to resale condominium property type from *realis2018_selected* data frame.

```{r}
realis2018_selected <- realis2018_summarised %>%
  filter(`Property Type` == "Condominium", `Type of Sale` == "Resale")
```

### 4.2 Use the basic arguments

Use three core arguments of *treemap()*, namely: *index*, *vSize* and *vColor* to design a basic treemap.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"
treemap(realis2018_selected,
        index=c("Planning Region", "Planning Area", "Project Name"),
        vSize="Total Unit Sold",
        vColor="Median Unit Price ($ psm)",
        title="Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017",
        title.legend = "Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)"
        )
```

::::: goals
::: goals-header

::: goals-container
-   `index`

    -   The index vector must consist of at least two column names or else no hierarchy treemap will be plotted.
    -   If multiple column names are provided, such as the code chunk above, the first name is the highest aggregation level, the second name the second highest aggregation level, and so on.

-   `vSize`

    The column must not contain negative values, because its values will be used to map the sizes of the rectangles of the treemaps.

**Warning**

The treemap above was **wrongly coloured**. For a correctly designed treemap, the colours of the rectagles should be in different intensity showing, in our case, median unit prices.

For *treemap()*, *vColor* is used in combination with the argument *type* to determine the colours of the rectangles. Without defining *type*, like the code chunk above, *treemap()* assumes type = index, in our case, the hierarchy of planning areas.
:::
:::::

### 4.3 Work with *vColor* and *type* arguments

In the code below, *type* argument is defined as "value".

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"
treemap(realis2018_selected,
        index=c("Planning Region", "Planning Area", "Project Name"),
        vSize="Total Unit Sold",
        vColor="Median Unit Price ($ psm)",
        type = "value",
        title="Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017",
        title.legend = "Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)"
        )
```

::::: goals
::: goals-header
Learning from the code
:::

::: goals-container
-   The rectangles are coloured with different intensity of green, reflecting their respective median unit prices.

-   The legend reveals that the values are binned into ten bins, i.e. 0-5,000, 5,000-10,000, etc. with an equal interval of 5,000.
:::
:::::

### 4.4 Colours in treemap package

There are two arguments that determine the mapping to color palettes: `mapping` and `palette`.

The only difference between “value” and “manual” is the default value for mapping.

The **“value” treemap** considers palette to be a diverging color palette (say ColorBrewer’s “RdYlBu”), and maps it in such a way that: - 0 corresponds to the middle color (typically white or yellow) - `-max(abs(values))` to the left-end color - `max(abs(values))` to the right-end color.

The **“manual” treemap** simply maps - `min(values)` to the left-end color - `max(values)` to the right-end color - `mean(range(values))` to the middle color.

:::::::: panel-tabset
## "value" type

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"

treemap(realis2018_selected,
        index=c("Planning Region", "Planning Area", "Project Name"),
        vSize="Total Unit Sold",
        vColor="Median Unit Price ($ psm)",
        type="value",
        palette="RdYlBu", 
        title="Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017",
        title.legend = "Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)"
        )
```

::::: goals
::: goals-header
Learning from the code
:::

::: goals-container
-   Although the colour palette used is RdYlBu but there are no red rectangles in the treemap above. This is because all the median unit prices are **positive**.

-   The reason why we see only 5000 to 45000 in the legend is because the range argument is by default c(min(values, max(values)) with some pretty rounding.
:::
:::::

## "manual" type

The “manual” type does not interpret the values as the “value” type does. Instead, the value range is mapped linearly to the colour palette.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"

treemap(realis2018_selected,
        index=c("Planning Region", "Planning Area", "Project Name"),
        vSize="Total Unit Sold",
        vColor="Median Unit Price ($ psm)",
        type="manual",
        palette="RdYlBu", 
        title="Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017",
        title.legend = "Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)"
        )
```

:::: goals
::: goals-header
Learning from the code
:::

-   The colour scheme used is very copnfusing. This is because mapping = (min(values), mean(range(values)), max(values)).

-   It is not wise to use diverging colour palette such as RdYlBu if the values are all positive or negative ::: goals-container

-   To overcome this, a single color palette should be used, such as **`Blues`**.
::::

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"
treemap(realis2018_selected,
        index=c("Planning Region", "Planning Area", "Project Name"),
        vSize="Total Unit Sold",
        vColor="Median Unit Price ($ psm)",
        type="manual",
        palette="Blues", 
        title="Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017",
        title.legend = "Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)"
        )
```
::::::::

## 4.7 Treemap layout

*reemap()* supports two popular treemap layouts, namely: `squarified` and `pivotSiz`e. The default is `pivotSize`.

The squarified treemap algorithm (Bruls et al., 2000) produces good aspect ratios, but ignores the sorting order of the rectangles (sortID). The ordered treemap, pivot-by-size, algorithm (Bederson et al., 2002) takes the sorting order (sortID) into account while aspect ratios are still acceptable.

::: panel-tabset
## *algorithm* argument

The code below plots a squarified treemap by changing the *algorithm* argument.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"

treemap(realis2018_selected,
        index=c("Planning Region", "Planning Area", "Project Name"),
        vSize="Total Unit Sold",
        vColor="Median Unit Price ($ psm)",
        type="manual",
        palette="Blues", 
        algorithm = "squarified",
        title="Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017",
        title.legend = "Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)"
        )
```

## *sortID*

When “pivotSize” algorithm is used, *sortID* argument can be used to dertemine the order in which the rectangles are placed from top left to bottom right.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"
treemap(realis2018_selected,
        index=c("Planning Region", "Planning Area", "Project Name"),
        vSize="Total Unit Sold",
        vColor="Median Unit Price ($ psm)",
        type="manual",
        palette="Blues", 
        algorithm = "pivotSize",
        sortID = "Median Transacted Price",
        title="Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017",
        title.legend = "Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)"
        )
```

## 5 Design Treemap Using treemapify Package

**treemapify** is a R package specially developed to draw treemaps in **ggplot2**. We will learn how to design treemps closely resembling treemaps from previous section by using **treemapify**.

Resources: - [Introduction to “treemapify”](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/treemapify/vignettes/introduction-to-treemapify.html) - [user guide](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/treemapify/treemapify.pdf).

### 5.1 Design a basic treemap

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"

ggplot(data=realis2018_selected, 
       aes(area = `Total Unit Sold`,
           fill = `Median Unit Price ($ psm)`),
       layout = "scol",
       start = "bottomleft") + 
  geom_treemap() +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "light blue", high = "blue") +
  theme(
      plot.title = element_text(hjust=0, family = "Bold"),
      plot.background = element_rect(fill = "#f1f4f5", color = "#f1f4f5"),
      legend.background = element_rect(fill="#f1f4f5"),
      panel.background = element_rect(fill="#f1f4f5"))   
```

### 5.2 Define hierarchy

::: panel-tabset
## Grouped by *Planning Region*.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"

ggplot(data=realis2018_selected, 
       aes(area = `Total Unit Sold`,
           fill = `Median Unit Price ($ psm)`,
           subgroup = `Planning Region`),
       start = "topleft") + 
  geom_treemap() +
  theme(
      plot.title = element_text(hjust=0, family = "Bold"),
      plot.background = element_rect(fill = "#f1f4f5", color = "#f1f4f5"),
      legend.background = element_rect(fill="#f1f4f5"),
      panel.background = element_rect(fill="#f1f4f5")) 
```

## Grouped by *Planning Area*

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"
ggplot(data=realis2018_selected, 
       aes(area = `Total Unit Sold`,
           fill = `Median Unit Price ($ psm)`,
           subgroup = `Planning Region`,
           subgroup2 = `Planning Area`)) +  #added as subgroup2
  geom_treemap()
```

## Add boundary line

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"
ggplot(data=realis2018_selected, 
       aes(area = `Total Unit Sold`,
           fill = `Median Unit Price ($ psm)`,
           subgroup = `Planning Region`,
           subgroup2 = `Planning Area`)) + 
  geom_treemap() +
  geom_treemap_subgroup2_border(colour = "pink", #add lines
                                size = 2) +
  geom_treemap_subgroup_border(colour = "#BB993E")
```
:::

## 6 Design Interactive Treemap using d3treeR

### 6.1 Install d3treeR package

Step 1. Install *devtool* package

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
```

Step 2. Load *devtool* library and install the package found in GitHub.

```{r}
library(devtools)
install_github("timelyportfolio/d3treeR")
force = TRUE
```

Step 3. Launch *d3treeR* package

```{r}
library(d3treeR)
```

### 6.2 Design an interactive treemap

#### 6.2.1 `treemap()` Base treemap

Step 1. treemap() is used to build a treemap by using selected variables in condominium data.frame. The treemap created is save as object called ***tm***.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"

tm <- treemap(realis2018_summarised,
        index=c("Planning Region", "Planning Area"),
        vSize="Total Unit Sold",
        vColor="Median Unit Price ($ psm)",
        type="value",
        title="Private Residential Property Sold, 2017",
        title.legend = "Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)"
        )
```

#### 6.2.2 `d3tree()` Interactive treemap

```{r}
#| fig-width: 7
#| fig-height: 4
d3tree(tm,rootname = "Singapore")
```
